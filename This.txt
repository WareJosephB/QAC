S- Single Responsibility Principle: One class should have only 1 responsibility; a Class should have 1 reason to change
O- Open/Closed Principle: Software components should be open for extension but closed for modification
L- Liskov's Substitution Principle: Derived Types must be completely substituble for their base type (i.e. Ostrich extends Bird so Bird shouldn't have fly()). Subclasses only extend not reduce
I- Interface Segregation Principle: Only put one thing in interfaces so user doesn't have to implement things the don't need
D- Dependency Inversion Principle: Give everything method needs to run as parameter, rather than method creating it
